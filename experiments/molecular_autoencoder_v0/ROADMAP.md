# Roadmap: capability gaps and technical debt

Written so that the distance between what this codebase does and what the
project is aiming at is on the record, rather than implied. The stated goal is
a foundation for modelling molecular machines — protein assemblies and
protein–compound systems — following the four-stage plan (autoencoder →
latent diffusion → mid-training on high-quality trajectories → RL against
quantum-accurate feedback).

Nothing here is a reason not to proceed. Several items are cheap. But a
roadmap that names none of them would read as though latent MD gets to
designed molecular machines on its own, and it does not.

---

## 1. Capability gaps

### 1.1 Design vs. modelling — the largest unstated leap
Everything built is a **forward** model: structure in, structure out. Machines
require the inverse — function to structure. Latent diffusion supplies a
generative prior, which is the right substrate for conditional design, but the
conditioning has never been specified. This is the biggest gap in the four-
stage plan and it is not addressed by any stage as currently written.

### 1.2 Interfaces, not global RMSD
Function lives in a binding interface of a few dozen atoms. A global all-atom
RMSD over a 2,500-atom complex can look excellent while the interface is
wrong. We have no interface-restricted metric.

*Partly mitigated:* `molae/pocket.py` crops to the ligand's neighbourhood,
which makes the interface the whole measurement instead of ~2% of it. Cropping
is not the same as an interface metric on the full complex.

### 1.3 Fixed covalent topology — bond forming/breaking is out of reach
Three specific blockers, in order of how hard they are to remove:

1. **The objective fights it.** Bond topology is fixed from the input frame
   (perceived, or read from `struct_conn`/prmtop) and then *restrained*. A
   trajectory in which a bond breaks is penalised by the bond-length loss.
2. **The atom set is fixed.** The decoder is conditioned on atom identity and
   emits into fixed slots. Atoms move; none appear or disappear. Reactions
   that change composition are outside the representation. Hydrogens are
   stripped, and that is where most reaction chemistry lives.
3. **No energetics.** Nothing in the model knows the barrier to breaking a
   bond. Classical restraints cannot supply it; that is quantum. Stage 4, and
   the least specified part of the plan.

Coordinates *do* implicitly encode topology — two atoms at 1.5 Å are bonded —
so the representation is not intrinsically barred from expressing bond
changes. Closing this needs: keep hydrogens, replace the fixed-topology
restraint with a predicted bond graph, and train on reactive trajectories
(AIMD/DFT) rather than classical MD. MISATO ships a QM component we deferred.

### 1.4 Assembly scale
Machines are 10⁴–10⁶ atoms. The latent is per-residue so it scales linearly,
but the clash loss is O(N²) (capped via `loss_max_atoms`) and reconstruction
quality currently degrades with size — see 3.1, where the cause is still open.

### 1.5 Non-canonical residue identity — MEASURED as the worst class
Non-canonical residues (SeMet, hydroxyproline, D-amino acids) are kept in
their chain with correct bonds, but collapse to a single `UNK` residue index
with ordinal slots. The model gets almost no chemical prior about *what* the
residue is.

Flagged as a known limitation when built; now measured. In `complex_d8`'s
four-way split the modified-residue class is worst at **9.99 Å** (protein
7.98, ligand-covalent 8.28, ligand-free 9.11), and the two worst structures
overall are small and modified-residue-heavy — 735 atoms with 30 such residues
at **19.4 Å**, 936 atoms with 4 at 14.6 Å.

Non-canonical amino acids are a primary tool for engineering designed
proteins, so this sits on the critical path rather than at the edge. Closing
it means real identity embeddings per non-canonical type, not one `UNK`
bucket.

---

## 2. Untested design choices

### 2.1 Equivariance, on the architecture that works
The codec is **not** equivariant and uses no graph/message-passing structure:
plain transformer attention, with invariance handled by input centring,
rotation augmentation, and Kabsch alignment in the loss. Bonds enter only
through the loss, never the forward pass.

An SE(3)-**invariant** encoder was tested (6.931 Å vs 7.137 Å baseline) — but
that A/B predates the direct decoder, and *every* arm in it loses to a
mean-shape baseline. It says nothing about whether equivariance helps the
codec that works. This is untested, cheap to test, and one of the more likely
remaining wins.

### 2.2 Temporal encoding in the codec
Frames are currently encoded **independently** and stacked into `(T, R, d)`;
all temporal modelling lives in the diffusion stage. Video VAEs compress time
as well as space, and MISATO's ~80 ps stride means consecutive frames are
highly redundant, so per-frame latents waste capacity.

Variants worth sweeping: windowed encoder (temporal context, no compression);
temporal compression (k frames → 1 latent frame); residual latents. Tension:
a per-frame codec trains on *all* static PDB, a temporal one only where
trajectories exist. Resolution is inflation — train spatial on PDB, add
zero-init temporal blocks, fine-tune on MD.

`drift_ratio` (in `molae/trajectory.py`) decides whether this is needed, and
needs no diffusion model to run.

### 2.3 Curriculum schedule
`molae/curriculum.py` exposes the schedule as four scalars, so it sweeps as a
config grid. Untested: whether a discrete mid-training phase beats a gradual
ramp, and where the shift should sit.

---

## 3. The complex-codec ceiling — what has been eliminated

`complex_d8` plateaus at ~5.5–5.9 Å all-atom against the 0.79 Å single-chain
reference. Six explanations have been tested and five are closed. Only
training-set size and the representation itself are still live.

**First, the noise floor — it qualifies every number below.** Held-out RMSD
over the last ten evaluations of a *single* complex run spreads far more than
the effects being measured:

| run | final | mean | sd | range |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `complex_d8` (242k) | 5.885 | 5.935 | 0.192 | 5.72–6.36 |
| `complex_d16` (63k) | 6.172 | 5.761 | 0.449 | 4.88–6.37 |
| `complex_d8_3m` (242k) | 5.804 | 5.869 | 0.199 | 5.47–6.22 |
| ladder n556 | 6.126 | 6.003 | 0.304 | 5.60–6.50 |
| ladder n1112 | 5.902 | 5.778 | 0.344 | 5.19–6.31 |
| ladder n2224 | 5.368 | 5.829 | 0.271 | 5.37–6.13 |

The evaluation is a deterministic pass over the whole val split, so this is
weight jitter, not measurement noise. It means **the final checkpoint is a
draw, not a measurement**, and two conclusions drawn from single draws do not
survive contact with it:

- The data ladder read 6.13 → 5.90 → 5.37 by final checkpoint — a 0.75 Å
  descent. By last-ten mean it is 6.00 → 5.78 → 5.83: **flat, inside the
  band**. n556 drew high and n2224 drew low.
- `complex_d16` read 0.59 Å worse than `complex_d8`. By mean it is 5.761 vs
  5.935 — **tied**, with the largest spread in the set. "Latent 16 is worse"
  is dead; "latent 16 does not help" is what the data supports.

`complex_d8_3m` is unaffected (5.869 vs 5.935, deep inside the band) — capacity
was already a null and stays one.

Two separate noise sources, and they need different treatment. *Temporal
jitter* — the final-checkpoint lottery — is what the table measures, and it is
fixable: `train.ema_decay` averages the weights, and `val_summary` in
`train_log.json` now reports last-N mean ± sd so a headline number cannot be a
single draw. *Seed variance* is only measurable by running seeds; the one
estimate we have is 0.806 / 0.908 on the single-chain task, spread 0.102.
Seeds run before the jitter is fixed measure the two convolved together.

**Undertraining — RULED OUT.** 63k steps gave 5.584 Å; 242k gave 5.884. Four
times the steps bought nothing.

**Model capacity — RULED OUT.** 1.1M gave 5.584 Å held-out; 3.8M (3.5×) gave
5.804 Å. Both plateau at train ~5.3, v/t ~1.1. More parameters bought
nothing and cost a little. This rules out *model* capacity only; `latent_dim`
was 8 in both arms and `d_model` does not touch it — that axis is (1) below.

**Assembly placement — SECONDARY, not primary.** Superimposing each chain or
domain independently recovers only 1.25 Å of the 5.79 Å total (22%). There
IS a real multi-chain penalty — single-chain 4.24 Å vs multi-chain 6.18 Å, a
step the linear `corr(rmsd, n_chains) = 0.075` was blind to — but it is not
the main term.

**Size — RULED OUT, and this one was a misreading.** Absolute per-part RMSD
rises 2.67 → 8.49 Å with part size, which read as "large chains are harder".
Normalised by radius it is FLAT: `rmsd/rg ≈ 0.29–0.38` across every real
chain/domain bin. The codec has **constant fractional precision**; absolute
RMSD grows only because the structures are physically bigger. "Quality
degrades with size" was substantially a property of the metric.

That reframes the problem. Against the reference at `rmsd/rg ≈ 0.06`, the
complex codec sits at ~0.3 — a **uniform ~5× relative gap**, not a
size-dependent failure. Three candidates remain:

1. **Latent budget — RULED OUT.** Constant fractional precision looked like
   the signature of a fixed per-residue budget: 8 floats buys a fixed
   fraction of the dynamic range. Counter-evidence was already on record —
   on the ≤800-atom band the latent saturates by dim 4 (d1 4.069, d2 1.405,
   d4 0.707, d8 0.693, d16 0.681) — and `complex_d16` confirmed it at
   complex scale: doubling the budget made it *worse*, not flat.
2. **Training-set size — MEASURED FLAT over 4×, pending the last rung.** A
   matched-composition, leakage-controlled ladder at 556 → 1112 → 2224 gives
   6.00 → 5.78 → 5.83 by last-ten mean (sd ~0.3, SE ~0.1). No slope. Note what
   this does and does not say: it bounds the effect of data over the range the
   corpus can span (4,848 train structures total), not over the 10–100× that
   the single-chain result was never tested against either. n4448 is running
   and could still bend it.
3. **The representation itself** (multi-chain + ligands + modified residues),
   which is what we wanted to add.

**Where in (3) the error actually is — residue-granularity decomposition.**
Chain granularity put placement at 22%, which read as "the parts are right,
the assembly is mostly fine, so the failure is local geometry". That inference
had a hole: a chain superimposed as a *rigid body* still carries every
per-residue misplacement inside it. Superimposing each residue independently
closes it:

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| global RMSD | 5.884 |
| residue-internal `part_rmsd` | 1.829 |
| placement (linear) | 4.055 — **69%** |
| placement (share of *squared* error) | **~90%** |
| single-chain val (n=31) | 4.126 |
| multi-chain val (n=155) | 6.236 |

RMSDs add in quadrature, not linearly, so the linear 69% understates it:
internal geometry is only `(1.829/5.884)² ≈ 10%` of the squared error.

The decisive line is the single-chain row. Those structures have **no chain
boundary**, and they still imply `√(4.126² − 1.829²) ≈ 3.70 Å` of placement
error — *larger* than the 2.11 Å multi-minus-single differential. So most
placement error is intra-chain and exists where the chain-boundary story
predicts none. That reorders the two candidate fixes:

- **Frame readout** (`model.dec_frames`) — reaches the 3.70 Å. The plain head
  maps one residue token through a single linear layer at a single output
  scale to 14×3 *absolute* coordinates: it must express a ~50 Å placement and
  a 1.5 Å bond length in the same units, and it re-emits the placement
  independently per atom, where it deforms the geometry it shares an output
  with. Frames send placement through 3 numbers and a rotation, moving the
  residue rigidly. Cost: **+1,161 params (+0.1%)**.
- **Chain awareness** (`model.dec_chain_aware`) — reaches at most the 2.11 Å
  differential. Still worth running: it is orthogonal, and it closes a real
  asymmetry (the encoder's featuriser has a chain embedding; the decoder had
  none, so its `res_pos` adjacency prior was false at every unmarked
  boundary). Cost: +133k params (+12%).

One methodological caveat on `part_rmsd`: Kabsch on a 4-atom group removes 6
DOF from 12 numbers, so per-residue superposition is permissive and the
internal term is biased *low* — which biases the placement share *high*. The
control is to run the same decomposition on the 0.79 Å single-chain reference
codec; the bias applies equally to both, so the comparison survives it even
though the absolute number does not.

With (1) closed and (2) measured flat, (3) is the only arm left standing.
Every lever that adds *more of something* — parameters (3.5×), latent budget
(2×), steps (4×), training structures (4×) — has now come back negative, and
none of them made the *train* RMSD better either. A model that cannot fit what
it has already seen is not short of anything you can add more of. The next
real experiment is a representational change, not a bigger version of this one.

One caveat on the v/t ratio, which fell 1.11 → 0.88 → 0.78 across the ladder
and looked like independent corroboration of a slope. At matched step counts
it is not clean: more data at the same steps means a worse train fit, which
lowers the ratio mechanically. It cannot be read as generalisation improving.

The specific suspicion about the readout: every atom reads slot
`(res_pos, slot_idx)` emitted from its own residue's latent. That is what made
variable-size decoding work at all, but it gives an atom no path to anything
outside its own residue — which is exactly what placing one chain relative to
another requires. The 22% assembly-placement term and the uniform `bb ≈ aa`
failure both sit where that predicts.

**Outstanding control:** rerun `ladder_direct_n2272` on current HEAD. Every
complex number was produced by code that changed substantially since 0.878 Å
was measured, and declared bonds in particular added 762 disulfides that
enter the *bond loss*. The loss is not the same function it was. If the
rerun reproduces 0.878 the chain of reasoning above is sound; if not, the
ceiling is measuring our own regression.

## 3b. Small molecules are relatively hardest

Parts with Rg < 8 Å (ligands, fragments) score `rmsd/rg = 0.85` against
0.29–0.38 for real chains. Small molecules are hard as a fraction of their
own radius. MISATO's ligands have a median of 28 heavy atoms, so this is
directly on the path — deliverable (b) should keep reporting the ligand class
separately rather than folding it into an all-atom mean.

---

## 4. Technical debt

### 4.1 `chain_idx` is overloaded
It means both "which polymer chain" (where the residue-adjacency bonding rule
is right) and "which separate molecule" (where it is not). Several
representation defects were cases where those two meanings disagreed. The
current behaviour is correct on every case tested, so this is not urgent — but
it is why the bugs arrived one at a time rather than together.

### 4.2 Geometric bond perception vs. declared topology
Reading `struct_conn` replaced three geometric heuristics and recovered a bond
class we had never perceived at all (disulfides: 0 across the entire project
before, 762 in the complex set after). It does not cover everything:

- **28%** of PDB entries carry no `struct_conn` at all, so intra-residue and
  intra-ligand topology there is still distance-perceived.
- Fe₄S₄ clusters sit entirely unbonded — the metal radii that correctly stop
  Zn–His *coordination* being read as covalent also sever the genuine Fe–S
  bonds *inside* a cluster, where the metal is part of the molecule. 33 atoms
  across 4 of 47 cached structures; recorded rather than patched, because a
  seventh geometric heuristic is the habit worth breaking.

The Chemical Component Dictionary answers both directly. **Closed for
MISATO** — AMBER prmtop supplies per-system bonds for all 16,972 systems — so
this is now a PDB-only question.

### 4.3 Milestone 1's bond metric never saw a disulfide
`REPORT.md`'s `bond_length_error` was computed on a corpus with zero
disulfides. It will not change the headline — reconstruction RMSD, chirality
and contact F1 do not depend on the bond-loss term — but it needs a footnote
once the difference is measured. Cheapest route: re-evaluate the committed
`ladder_direct3m_n2272` checkpoint against a `struct_conn`-corrected dataset.
Evaluation only, no retraining.

---

## 5. What is actually established

Worth stating alongside the gaps, since the list above is all deficits:

- The direct per-residue codec reconstructs held-out protein structures at
  **0.79 Å all-atom / 0.51 Å backbone**, chirality 0.0002, contact F1 0.963.
- It is **data-limited, not plateaued** — val still descending at n=2272,
  val/train 1.50 and closing. We have used ~1% of the experimental archive.
- The fixed-size Perceiver alternative is **dead in direction**: its gap to
  the direct codec *widens* with data (ratio 7.11 → 7.71 vs direct-1.1M).
- The ordinal-slot addressing that makes ligands representable **works**:
  ligand-covalent 8.28 ≈ protein 7.98 in the same structures.
- Masked reconstruction is neutral on the direct codec (1.016 vs 1.020).
- The codec does **not** average conformers away: on NMR ensembles the
  conformational spread survives the round trip at ratio 0.868. That was the
  failure that would have killed the temporal stage outright.
- But its latent is only weakly organised *by* conformation: rho 0.933 against
  a random-projection control at 0.875, a gain of just +0.058. A codec that
  has never seen two conformers of one molecule has no reason to organise
  them, and the number reflects that — which is the measured argument for
  temporal context in the encoder (2.2).
- Predicted structures differ from experimental ones in GLOBAL SHAPE, not in
  bonds: within-type bond-length spread matches (1.05×), but 56% of raw
  computed structure models are extended (rg_ratio > 1.5) against 2% of
  experimental entries. Confidence filtering of the predicted tier is
  therefore load-bearing, not optional, and mixing ratios must be set on the
  filtered count.

## 6. Distance to molecular manufacturing — an audit against Drexler's criteria

The stated goal is a foundation for designed molecular machines. That goal is
usually discussed in its popular form, which is not testable. Drexler's own
technical criteria are testable, so this section audits the stack against
those instead — chiefly *Nanosystems* (1992) and the 1981 PNAS paper.

### 6.1 The entry path we are on is the one Drexler named

The 1981 paper opens: "Development of the ability to design protein molecules
will open a path to the fabrication of devices to complex atomic
specifications." The 2006 preface restates it: DNA frameworks, engineered
proteins binding at precise locations, "proteins themselves can serve as
construction machinery."

So a protein/complex structure model is the right *beachhead*, and building
toward protein-compound and protein-protein assemblies is not a detour. The
representation work already done is directly on this path: multi-chain
addressing, ordinal-slot ligand groups, declared covalent anchoring, and
disulfides give us atomically precise multi-component assemblies, which is
the object class the entry path operates on.

That is the half of the claim that holds. The rest of this section is the
half that does not.

### 6.2 The load-bearing number we cannot compute: positional stiffness

*Nanosystems'* feasibility argument for mechanosynthesis is not qualitative.
It reduces to one inequality. Thermal displacement along a coordinate with
restoring force `ks` is

    sigma^2 = kT / ks

and a misreaction means landing on an adjacent lattice site instead of the
target. At 300 K with a 0.25 nm diamond (111) site spacing, an error rate
below 1e-15 requires `ks > ~5 N/m`. That single number is what decides
whether positional control can guide chemistry — everything else in the
argument rests on it. (For scale: a C–C bond bends at ~30 N/m; a
cubic-nanometer block of diamond shears at ~500 N/m. The requirement is not
extreme, which is precisely why the argument works.)

**Our model cannot produce that number, or any number like it.** It emits
coordinates. It has no notion of force, stiffness, curvature of a potential,
or free energy. Given a proposed molecular linkage it cannot say whether the
linkage is stiff enough to place a reactive group reliably — which is the
only question that matters for the mechanical half of the program.

This is a sharper statement of the "no energetics" blocker in 1.3, and it is
worth separating because it does not require reactive chemistry to fix.
Stiffness is a property of a *stable* structure near its equilibrium. A model
that predicted per-coordinate curvature — equivalently, normal modes — would
supply it without ever modelling a bond breaking.

**A falsifiable gate.** Predict `ks` along a designated coordinate of a rigid
molecular linkage and agree with normal-mode analysis (or with the
fluctuation `sigma^2` measured in explicit-solvent MD) to within a stated
factor. Until something like that passes, claims that this stack is a
foundation for designed machines are aspiration, not capability.

### 6.3 Materials scope — an architectural limit, not a vocabulary gap

Drexler's machines are diamondoid: carbon-rich covalent solids, with metals
and semiconductors for electronic components. The 1995 paper is explicit that
this class was chosen because its mechanical properties are extremal and are
"well described by highly localized models based on two-, three- and
four-body potentials."

Our decoder addresses atoms by `(group, slot)` — generalised from `(residue,
atom name)`. A diamond lattice has no residues, no sequence, and no natural
group decomposition; a nanotube has periodicity but no side chains. Extending
the element vocabulary does not fix this. The addressing scheme that made
variable-size decoding work at all is specialised to polymers-with-sidechains
plus small ordinal groups, and it does not reach the material class the
mechanical program is built from.

This compounds the concern already raised in 3 about the per-residue readout:
the same design decision that may be capping complex reconstruction is also
the one that bounds our materials scope.

### 6.4 What the four-stage plan already covers, and what it does not

- **Stage 1 (codec).** Delivers the representation for atomically precise
  assemblies. On the path. Working.
- **Stage 2 (latent diffusion).** Delivers a generative prior — the right
  substrate for conditional design, though the conditioning is unspecified
  (1.1).
- **Stage 3 (mid-training on trajectories).** Delivers dynamics. Relevant to
  machine *behaviour*, not to whether a machine is buildable.
- **Stage 4 (RL against quantum-accurate feedback).** This is where
  energetics enters, and therefore where every capability in 6.2 and 1.3
  lives. It is also the least specified stage in the plan.

The honest summary: the plan's own stage 4 is the load-bearing stage for the
molecular-manufacturing goal, and it is the stage we have designed least.
Stages 1–3 build a forward model of biological-materials structure and
motion. That is a real foundation for the entry path Drexler named. It is not
yet a foundation for the mechanical engineering that follows it.

### 6.5 What would move the needle soonest

In rough order of leverage per unit effort:

1. **Any energetic output at all** — even a learned force field head
   predicting per-atom forces on a fixed topology. It converts the codec from
   a shape model into something that can rank designs.
2. **Interface metrics** (1.2, partly mitigated by `pocket.py`). A binding
   interface of a few dozen atoms is what a molecular device *does*; global
   RMSD is nearly blind to it.
3. **Non-canonical residue identity** (1.5) — measured as our worst class,
   and non-canonical amino acids are a primary tool for engineered proteins.
4. **Inverse conditioning** (1.1) — the largest gap, but it needs 1–3 to be
   worth anything, since a design model without a way to score designs is a
   random generator.

None of this changes the current queue. The regression control and the data
ladder decide whether the numbers we already have are real, and there is no
point building stage 4 on a foundation whose measurements have not survived a
seed-variance check.
